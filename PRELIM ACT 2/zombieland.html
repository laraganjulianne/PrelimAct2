	<h4>Nerdy college student Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has survived the plague that has 
	turned mankind into flesh-devouring zombies because he’s scared of just about everything. 
	Gun-toting, Twinkie-loving Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) has no fears. Together, 
	they are about to stare down their most horrifying challenge yet: each other’s company. 
	Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin co-star in this double-hitting, head-smashing comedy.</h4>
